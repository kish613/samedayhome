## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

### Business-Only Responses
The AI is programmed to ONLY answer business-related questions. If users ask about:
- General topics
- Other companies
- Unrelated advice

The AI will politely redirect: *"I'm specifically here to help with Same Day Home Buyer services and property sales. Is there anything about our fast cash purchase service I can help you with?"*

### Fallback Handling
If the OpenAI API fails:
- User sees: "I'm having trouble connecting. Please call us at 0330 043 7570..."
- No error messages exposed
- Graceful degradation

### Rate Limiting
- Natural conversation limiting through OpenAI
- No server-side rate limiting needed for now (can add later if needed)

---

## üì± Mobile Optimization

- Responsive width: `calc(100vw - 48px)` on mobile
- Positioned 80px from bottom (above BottomNav)
- Touch-friendly tap targets
- Smaller collapsed button (56px)
- Optimized height: 70vh on mobile vs 560px desktop

---

## üß™ Testing

### Test Questions to Try:
1. "How fast can you complete?"
2. "Do you charge any fees?"
3. "What properties do you buy?"
4. "Why is the offer below market value?"
5. "How do I get a valuation?"
6. "Do you buy properties in poor condition?"
7. "What's the referral program?"
8. "How are you different from estate agents?"

### Off-Topic Test:
- "What's the weather today?" ‚Üí Should redirect to business topics

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Chatbot not appearing?
1. Check `src/components/Layout.jsx` includes `<SupportChatbot />`
2. Verify no z-index conflicts with other fixed elements
3. Check browser console for errors

### AI not responding?
1. Verify `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in `.env`
2. Check `/api/chatbot` endpoint is accessible
3. Check Vercel deployment includes the API route
4. Look at Vercel function logs for errors

### API costs too high?
1. Add rate limiting (max 10 messages per session)
2. Reduce `max_tokens` in `api/chatbot.js` (currently 300)
3. Use shorter system prompt (but may reduce quality)
