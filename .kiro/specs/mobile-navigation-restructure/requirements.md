# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Same Day Home Buyer website currently has no mobile navigation system, with the main navigation hidden on mobile devices (hidden xl:flex). Users on mobile devices cannot access the main navigation links, creating a poor user experience. This feature aims to implement a top-positioned hamburger menu navigation system for mobile devices while keeping the desktop navigation unchanged.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Top Hamburger Menu Implementation

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want a hamburger menu icon at the top of the page, so that I can access the main navigation without scrolling to the bottom or being unable to navigate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the site on mobile (screens smaller than xl breakpoint) THEN the system SHALL display a hamburger menu icon in the top-right corner of the header
2. WHEN a user taps the hamburger menu icon THEN the system SHALL open a full-screen navigation overlay with smooth slide-in animation
3. WHEN the navigation overlay is open THEN the system SHALL display all main navigation links (How It Works, Why Us, Compare, Reviews, FAQs) with touch-friendly spacing
4. WHEN a user taps a navigation link THEN the system SHALL close the overlay and scroll to the appropriate section
5. WHEN a user taps outside the navigation content or a close button THEN the system SHALL close the navigation overlay with smooth slide-out animation
6. WHEN the navigation is open THEN the system SHALL prevent background scrolling

### Requirement 2: Desktop Navigation Preservation

**User Story:** As a desktop user, I want the existing navigation to remain unchanged, so that my browsing experience is not affected by mobile improvements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the site on desktop (xl breakpoint and above) THEN the system SHALL display the existing horizontal navigation bar
2. WHEN on desktop THEN the system SHALL NOT display the hamburger menu icon
3. WHEN on desktop THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing navigation functionality and styling
4. WHEN switching between desktop and mobile viewports THEN the system SHALL seamlessly transition between navigation styles

### Requirement 3: Visual Consistency and Branding

**User Story:** As a user, I want the mobile navigation to match the site's design and branding, so that the experience feels cohesive and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the mobile navigation is displayed THEN the system SHALL use the same color scheme as the existing site (blue-900, white, etc.)
2. WHEN navigation links are displayed THEN the system SHALL use consistent typography and styling with the desktop version
3. WHEN the hamburger icon is displayed THEN the system SHALL use appropriate sizing and positioning that matches the header design
4. WHEN animations are used THEN the system SHALL use smooth, professional transitions that enhance the user experience
5. WHEN the overlay is open THEN the system SHALL maintain visual hierarchy and readability

### Requirement 4: Touch Optimization

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want navigation elements to be easily tappable, so that I can navigate without precision issues or accidental taps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigation links are displayed THEN the system SHALL ensure minimum 44px touch targets
2. WHEN navigation items are stacked THEN the system SHALL provide adequate spacing between touch targets
3. WHEN the hamburger icon is displayed THEN the system SHALL be easily tappable with appropriate touch target size
4. WHEN users interact with navigation elements THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback on touch
5. WHEN the close functionality is provided THEN the system SHALL offer multiple ways to close (close button, outside tap, link selection)

### Requirement 5: Performance and Accessibility

**User Story:** As a mobile user with accessibility needs, I want the navigation to be fast and accessible, so that I can use the site regardless of my abilities or device performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the navigation is toggled THEN the system SHALL respond immediately without lag
2. WHEN screen readers are used THEN the system SHALL provide proper ARIA labels and semantic markup
3. WHEN keyboard navigation is used THEN the system SHALL provide proper focus management and tab order
4. WHEN the navigation state changes THEN the system SHALL announce changes to screen readers appropriately
5. WHEN animations are used THEN the system SHALL respect user preferences for reduced motion
6. WHEN the navigation loads THEN the system SHALL not impact the overall page performance
